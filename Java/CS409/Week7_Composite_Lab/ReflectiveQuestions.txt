1. What are the pros and cons of treating individual and grouped objects uniformly?
    Pros
        Simplifies client code
            The client does not need to be able to distinguish between an object and a composition of objects, reducing conditional logic and therefore cleans up code
        Scalable and consistant
            It is easy to add new Leaf types as they will still get treated the same way due to them implementing a common interface
        Recursion
            Recursion is handled very well using this design pattern
    Cons
        Added complexity
            Adding the layer of abstraction required to treat a Leaf and a Composition as the same, adds additonal complexity
        Debugging
            As the client thinks both a Leaf and a Composition are the same thing, debugging can become an issue as errors can be hard to trace back


2. How would you extend this system to support transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation)?
    Add transformation methods to the abstract interface
    Create variables to store the transformations in each object
        Leaf
            Apply transformation directly to the single Leaf object
        Composite
            Iterate through children and apply transformation to each Leaf


3. What challenges might arise when deeply nesting groups?
    Performance
        There is the possibility of a significant number of recursive calls. Each call adds to the call stack
    Complexity

    Cyclic Issues
