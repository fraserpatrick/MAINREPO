1. What are the pros and cons of treating individual and grouped objects uniformly?
    Pros
        Simplifies client code
            The client does not need to be able to distinguish between an object and a composition of objects, reducing conditional logic and therefore cleans up code
        Scalable and consistant
            New Leaf objects or compositions can be added without any change to the client code due to them implementing a common interface and therefore being treated uniformly
        Recursion
            This design supports recursion on hierarchial structures
    Cons
        Added complexity
            Adding the layer of abstraction required to treat a Leaf and a Composition as the same, adds additonal complexity
        Debugging
            As the client thinks both a Leaf and a Composition are the same thing, debugging can become an issue as errors can be hard to trace back


2. How would you extend this system to support transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation)?
    Add transformation methods to the abstract interface, like scale() or rotate()
    Create variables to store the transformations in each Leaf object
    Leaf implemetation
        Apply transformation directly to the single Leaf object
    Composite implemetation
        Iterate through children and apply transformation to each Leaf


3. What challenges might arise when deeply nesting groups?
    Performance
        There is the possibility of a significant number of recursive calls and each call adds to the call stack. 
        This can lead to a high memory usage and slower processing
    Complexity
        Deep structures are harder to understand, maintain and debug due to the higher level of complexity
        Traversing or changing the hierarchy is a lot more error-prone in a deep structure
    Cyclic Issues
        There is a chance of there being accidental cycles where a composition could indirectly contain itself
        This can lead to infinite loops or stack overflow issues
