1. What are the pros and cons of using an adapter versus rewriting the legacy class?
    Pros
        Fast Implementation
            Tends to be a faster than refactoring a whole code base, as you only need to write a small amount of code to bridge the gap
        Backward compatibility
            Both old and new systems can maintain compatibility meaning old systems can continue running without issue
        Low risk
            Refactoring a whole code base comes with the risk of breaking stable code, whereas adding an adapter will maintain stable legacy code
    Cons
        Complexity
            The extra added layer creates added complexity which can make the program harder to read, understand and debug
        Limited flexibility
            The design of the legacy code cannot be changed therefore it can be hard to add new features 


2. How does the Adapter pattern help with integrating third-party or legacy systems?
    Connects mismatched interfaces
        The legacy code can have differently named variables and methods, the adapter can connect the 2 to allow both systems to keep working
    Not able to refactor
        Some third-party or legacy codebases are not able to be refactored, an adapter means they don't have to be
    Improved maintainability
        If the third party code gets changed then only the adapter will need to be updated instead of your entire system

3. How would you handle adapting more complex behaviors, like obstacle avoidance or path planning? Would you still use an adapter?
    No, you would not use an adapter
    An adapter only adapts old, already written methods and variables and is not for adding new functionality
    You would use an adapter to use the legacy code but would then use a different design pattern to add the new functionality
    If the old code is too awkward to adapt then you could consider refactoring
