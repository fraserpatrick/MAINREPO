# Week 2 â€“ Singleton Pattern

## Objective
Learn how to implement the Singleton design pattern to ensure a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Task
You will implement a `Logger` class that follows the Singleton pattern. This logger will be used to log messages from different parts of an application.

### Provided Files
- `Logger.java`: A partially implemented class with a private constructor.
- `Main.java`: A demo file to test your implementation.
- `LoggerTest.java`: JUnit tests to verify your implementation.

### Your Tasks
1. Complete the `Logger` class:
   - Implement the Singleton pattern using a private static instance.
   - Provide a public static method `getInstance()` to access the instance.
   - Add a method `log(String message)` that prints the message prefixed with a timestamp.

2. Use the `Logger` in `Main.java` to log a few messages.

3. Run the provided JUnit tests to verify your implementation.

## Reflective Questions
1. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using the Singleton pattern?
2. How would you make your Singleton implementation thread-safe?
3. In what scenarios should Singleton be avoided, and why?

## Deliverables
1. Your completed code submissions
2. A screnshot showing the tests have been ran (and passed)
3. A text document, answering the reflective questions.
