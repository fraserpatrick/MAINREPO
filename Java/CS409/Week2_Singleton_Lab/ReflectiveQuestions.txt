1. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using the Singleton pattern?
	Benefits: 
		Controlled access to a single instance
			This ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the entire program
		Global access
			A controlled global variable so can be accessed from anywhere in the program
	Drawbacks:
		Concurrency issues
			A non-thread safe program could possibly create multiple instances
		Global state
			Can be issues due to every class in the program having access to it


2. How would you make your Singleton implementation thread-safe?
	Eager initialisation
		This creates the instance of the class as soon as the class is first loaded, this ensures the instance is available immediately.
	CODE SNIPPET
		public class Singleton {
			private static final Singleton inst = new Singleton();

			private Singleton() {
				System.out.println("Singleton instance created");
			}

			public static Singleton getInstance() {
				return inst;
			}
		}
	END OF CODE SNIPPET

	Pros:
		Immediate availability
			Due to the instance being created on class loading, it will be already created and available when requested
		Thread safe
			As the instance is created on class load it means that it can't be loaded by multiple threads
	Cons:
		Resource waste
			Due to the instance being created on class load, there is a chance that it's not actually needed during the programs runtime, and therefore using uncessicary resources
		Slow overhead
			Being created on start up can mean that the start up can be slowed down due to the extra process of creating an instance
		

3. In what scenarios should Singleton be avoided, and why?
