1. What advantages does the Decorator Pattern offer over subclassing?
    Dynamic at runtime
        Decorator's are able to be added, removed or combined dynamically at runtime just by wrapping different objects in different combinations
        Subclassing modifies the object at compile so it's behavior is then fixed once its been defined
    Class explosion
        Adding extra options creates more and more combinations, having a new subclass for each combination means that you could end up with hundereds of classes
        Whereas decorators mean you only need to make a new class for each option which can then be combined as needed
    Single Responsibility Principle
        Each decorator only needs to deal with a single responsibility, this makes the decorators more readable and easier to maintain.


2. What challenges might arise when stacking multiple decorators?
    Ordering
        The order in which decorators are applied can have an effect on the output and behavior of the decorated class, meaning that the output you get might not be the output you expect
    Debugging
        Due to there being multiple layers of decorators debugging can be an issue as it can be hard to find where the bug is coming from
    Identity issues
        There can be issues as the object that is outputed after being passed through a decorator will not be the same class type as the inputed object meaning that some calls might throw errors


3. Could this pattern be used for input validation or logging? Why or why not?
    Yes
        You can create a decorater class to add the extra code functionalilty without having to change main codebase.
        This makes the system more flexible as classes can be wrapped in each decorator as required
    CODE SNIPPET
        public class LoggerValidationPrinter extends PrinterDecorator {
            public LoggerValidationPrinter(Printer wrappedPrinter) {
                super(wrappedPrinter);
            }

            @Override
            public String print(String input) {
                SOME LOGGING OR VALIDATION FUNCTIONALILTY
                return super.print(input);
            }
        }
    END OF CODE SNIPPET
